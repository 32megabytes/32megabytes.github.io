          <p>If you leave the server while in purgatory, you will be permanently IP banned immediately.  -Everything in #rules still apply, but will result in an IP ban instead of another warning. </p>
          <p><strong>Terms of coming back</strong></p>
        <p>If you are unbanned, you will have two warnings left before a permanent IP ban,   with one new warning coming back each month until you have 4 left again.  -If you run out of warnings after being unbanned, you will be permanently IP banned.  -You only get two chances, and being unbanned is your 2nd one. </p></td>
