	  <p>Due to unforseen personal &amp; industry-related circumstances, I've made the difficult decision to take a hiatus from offering my photography services.  I hope to return to the industry at some point should it be viable. In the meantime, due to costs this website will be kept behind this page and all e-mail inboxes will be shut off effective immediately. All myGallery &amp; Pixieset photo galleries will go offline by 12/31/2022. Thanks again to everyone who supported me and my photography business, so many personal and professional milestones were enabled by my clients and I'm truly thankful for the experience. </p>
